Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
George Rogers
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Wednesday night TA hours
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It's a lot more confusing than Python, but I am catching on to the syntax. It is surprisingly easier to code procedurally in Java than it is to code object orientedly in Python
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
The logic you apply to it is the same, you simply have to say everything in a much more complicated way. Also, making your code legible is entirely on you, and it's very easy to slack off, because the machine can read your code, but then you look back and you're like "what the hell have I been doing for the past hour?"
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Starting it earlier definitely worked out well for me, it went much better than the first coding assignment that I started two hours before it was due. Additionally, working with someone next to you. Even if it isn't pair programming necessarily, it's nice to have someone you can consult on the little syntax questions.
